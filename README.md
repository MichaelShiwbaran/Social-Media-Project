# Social-Media-Project
This project allows a user to create their own account with a username and password and create unique posts, similar to social media websites. 
It utilizes data structures like vectors, arrays, linked lists, queues, and stacks. 
As well as bubble sorting and pointer variables to create, delete, change, and re-order posts, usernames, and accounts.
